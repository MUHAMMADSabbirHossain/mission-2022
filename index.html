                <p>As a general approach, it is safer to have playdates with children from other families outdoors where
                    possible, as the COVID-19 virus doesn’t spread as easily in such settings. Physical distancing is
                    also likely easier to manage for you and your children than indoors. If you allow your children to
                    play outside with friends, consider limiting it to just a few other kids and encouraging physical
                    distancing.</p>
